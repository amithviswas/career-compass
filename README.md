## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amithviswas/career-compass.git
    cd career-compass
    ```
    
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    # or
    # pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project. Add your Firebase and Google AI (Genkit) API keys:

    ```env
    # Firebase Configuration (Optional - mock auth is default)
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID

    # Genkit and Google AI (Gemini)
    # Ensure you have a Google AI Studio API key or have Google Cloud application default credentials set up.
    # Genkit uses GOOGLE_API_KEY or GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS from the environment.
    # If using GOOGLE_API_KEY:
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY
    ```
    *   **Note on Firebase Auth:** The current public version uses a mocked authentication system in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` for easier setup. To use actual Firebase Authentication, you'll need to uncomment the Firebase-related code in that file and `src/lib/firebase.ts`, and ensure your Firebase project is correctly configured with these credentials.
    *   **Google AI API Key:** You can obtain a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

4.  **Run the development server for the Next.js app:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Next.js application, typically available at `http://localhost:9002`.

5.  **Run the Genkit development server (in a separate terminal):**
    The AI flows are served by Genkit.
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    Or, for automatic reloading on changes to AI flow files:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This starts the Genkit development server, often on `http://localhost:3400`. Your Next.js app communicates with this server for AI functionalities.

## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

*   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode with Turbopack.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
*   `npm run start`: Starts a Next.js production server.
*   `npm run lint`: Runs the linter.
*   `npm run typecheck`: Performs TypeScript type checking.
*   `npm run genkit:dev`: Starts the Genkit development server.
*   `npm run genkit:watch`: Starts the Genkit development server with file watching.

## üí° AI Functionality Details

This project leverages Genkit to interface with Google's generative AI models (e.g., Gemini). All AI-driven logic is encapsulated in "flows" located in the `src/ai/flows/` directory. These flows handle tasks such as:
*   Parsing and analyzing resume text.
*   Generating structured content (summaries, bullet points, plans).
*   Evaluating interview answers.
*   Crafting creative text (cover letters, LinkedIn headlines).
*   Responding to chat queries.

A local Genkit server (started with `npm run genkit:dev` or `npm run genkit:watch`) must be running for the AI features to work.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Potential Ideas)

*   Persistent storage of user-generated artifacts (resumes, cover letters, interview results) in Firestore.
*   Deeper integration with LinkedIn API for direct profile data import/export.
*   Advanced analytics on mock interview performance over time.
*   Job search aggregation and application tracking features.
*   Community features for peer review or sharing career journeys.
